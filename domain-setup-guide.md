# MyNovelCraft Domain Configuration Guide

## Issue
- ✅ **Working**: https://my-novel-craft-campbellinoz.replit.app/
- ❌ **Failing**: https://mynovelcraft.com/ (Returns 404)

## Root Cause
The custom domain `mynovelcraft.com` is not properly configured to point to the Replit infrastructure.

## Required DNS Configuration

### At Your Domain Registrar
You need to configure these DNS records for `mynovelcraft.com`:

**Option 1: CNAME Record (Recommended)**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Value: my-novel-craft-campbellinoz.replit.app
TTL: 300 (or Auto)
```

**Option 2: A Record**
```
Type: A  
Name: @
Value: [Replit's IP address - contact Replit support for current IP]
TTL: 300
```

### In Replit Project Settings
1. Go to your Replit project settings
2. Navigate to "Domains" section
3. Ensure `mynovelcraft.com` is listed as a custom domain
4. Verify SSL certificate status

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check DNS Propagation
```bash
# Check if DNS records are properly set
dig mynovelcraft.com
nslookup mynovelcraft.com
```

### 2. Test Domain Response
```bash
# Should return 200 OK, not 404
curl -I https://mynovelcraft.com/
```

### 3. Verify SSL Certificate
```bash
# Should show valid SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect mynovelcraft.com:443 -servername mynovelcraft.com
```

## Current Application Status
- ✅ **Health Check**: All systems healthy
- ✅ **Database**: Connected (958ms response time)  
- ✅ **SSL/HTTPS**: Working on Replit URL
- ✅ **Authentication**: Functioning correctly
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: All present

## Expected After Fix
Once DNS is properly configured:
- `https://mynovelcraft.com/` will load the application
- SSL certificate will be valid for the custom domain
- Replit deployment verification will pass
- Google OAuth will work with custom domain callbacks

## Contact Support
If DNS configuration doesn't resolve the issue:
1. Contact your domain registrar for DNS setup help
2. Contact Replit support for custom domain configuration
3. Verify your domain ownership with Replit
