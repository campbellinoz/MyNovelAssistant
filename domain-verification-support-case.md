# Replit Domain Verification Support Case

## Issue Summary
Custom domain mynovelcraft.com has been stuck in routing configuration for 9+ hours, well beyond the expected 15 minutes to few hours timeframe.

## Timeline

**August 18, 2025 - 05:05 UTC**: Domain mynovelcraft.com added to Replit deployment
**05:06 UTC - 14:17 UTC**: Domain consistently returning 404 status (9+ hours)
**14:17 UTC**: Issue escalated due to excessive delay

## Technical Verification

### DNS Configuration ✅ CORRECT
- **A Record**: mynovelcraft.com → 34.111.179.208 (verified working)
- **TXT Record**: replit-verify=baaee1d9-7896-42db-81e7-a3b4b807a44c (configured)

### Infrastructure Status ✅ WORKING
- DNS resolution: Working correctly
- SSL certificate: Active and valid
- Domain reaching Replit servers: Confirmed (404 response indicates routing issue, not DNS)

### Application Status ✅ OPERATIONAL
- Development environment: Running normally
- Database: Connected to production Neon database
- API endpoints: Functional via development URL

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected**: Domain verification completes within 15 minutes to few hours
**Actual**: 9+ hours with persistent 404 status

## Account Details
- Email: campbellinoz@gmail.com
- Subscription: Studio Plan
- Deployment: Autoscale (1 vCPU, 2 GiB RAM)
- Database: Neon (holy-river)

## Domain Registration
- Domain registered through Replit (automatic DNS management)
- No manual A/TXT record configuration required per Replit documentation

## Previous Communication Attempts
- Multiple support emails sent with no response
- This extended delay requires infrastructure team investigation

## Request
Please investigate the routing configuration for mynovelcraft.com and expedite the domain verification process. All client-side configuration is correct - this appears to be a Replit infrastructure routing issue.

**Case Priority**: High - Production domain launch blocked for 9+ hours
