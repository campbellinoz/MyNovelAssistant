# Replit Domain Configuration Fix

## Issue
Domain `mynovelcraft.com` was registered by Replit but returns 404 errors.

## Root Cause
Replit-registered domains should automatically point to the app, but the deployment configuration is not properly set up.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check Deployment Configuration
- Go to your Replit project
- Click on "Deployments" tab
- Verify the deployment type (Static, Autoscale, or Reserved VM)
- Ensure the deployment is active and healthy

### 2. Configure Custom Domain in Deployment
- In the Deployments tab, look for "Domains" or "Custom Domains" section
- Add `mynovelcraft.com` to the custom domains list
- The domain should show "Verified" status since it's Replit-managed

### 3. Check Current Status
From the documentation:
- Domains purchased through Replit are "automatically configured"
- Should be "accessible at the custom domain instantly"
- No additional DNS setup required for Replit-managed domains

### 4. Deployment Requirements
- Custom domains work with: Autoscale, Reserved VM, and Static deployments
- Ensure your deployment type supports custom domains
- Verify the deployment is running and accessible via the .replit.app URL

## Current Working URL
✅ https://my-novel-craft-campbellinoz.replit.app/

## Expected After Fix
✅ https://mynovelcraft.com/ (should load the same app)

## If Still Not Working
1. Check if the project needs to be redeployed
2. Verify the deployment type supports custom domains
3. Contact Replit support for domain configuration issues
