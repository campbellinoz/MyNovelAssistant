## Recent Changes (August 2025)
- âœ… Fixed subscription tier display for Studio users (shows "Studio Plan (Admin)" correctly)
- âœ… Removed inappropriate "Upgrade to Premium" button for Studio tier users  
- âœ… Corrected chapter drag-and-drop to allow bidirectional movement (both up and down)
- âœ… Fixed verification script user count expectation (1 user instead of 2)
- âœ… **RESOLVED: Database configuration reset issue during deployments**
  - Problem: Individual database environment variables (PGHOST, PGPASSWORD, PGUSER, PGDATABASE) conflicted with DATABASE_URL during redeployments
  - Solution: Removed individual variables, kept only DATABASE_URL pointing to holy-river Neon database
  - Result: Production deployments now maintain correct database connection consistently
- âœ… **RESOLVED: Admin subscription management database updates**
  - Problem: Subscription end date changes were not persisting to the database despite successful API responses
  - Root Cause: Storage layer treated undefined values as "don't update" instead of handling null values for field clearing
  - Solution: Updated storage interface to accept Date | null, fixed field clearing logic, enhanced real-time UI updates
  - Result: Admin can now successfully update subscription tiers, set/clear end dates, with immediate form feedback and database persistence
- âœ… **Enhanced chapter writing validation and navigation**
  - Added "Start Writing" button validation with toast notifications to prevent opening editor without selected chapter
  - Improved admin dashboard back navigation to use browser history instead of hardcoded main dashboard link

- ðŸ”„ Custom domain verification in progress: mynovelcraft.com added to deployment (05:05 UTC), DNS/SSL working, final routing configuration pending
  - **08:01 UTC**: Comprehensive support case submitted to Replit with technical documentation after 9+ hour delay
  - **CRITICAL**: 48+ hours delay, but support finally responded - working with Replit to resolve routing issue
- âœ… Enhanced monitoring with domain diagnostic capabilities

## User Preferences
